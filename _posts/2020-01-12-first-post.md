Hello, my name is Samyak S Sarnayak. I'm a student of PES University, Bengaluru, India. This is the first post on my own website!.

I plan to use this to post tutorials on Python, Julia, Deep Learning and anything else that interests me.

This was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Thank you for reading!.
